After the 2020 New York City Marathon was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[1] the 2021 race was confirmed in June 2021 by Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo.[2] It is scheduled to be held on its traditional date of the first Sunday in November.[2] It will be the last of the five World Marathon Majors held in 2021; all of the events in the series are being run in the space of six weeks between late September and early November.[3][a] The 2021 New York City Marathon is sponsored by Tata Consultancy Services.[5]

Due to the ongoing pandemic, the number of runners will be limited to 33,000,[2] and competitors will be required to either prove that they are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or have a recent negative COVID-19 test.[6] Competitors will be required to wear face coverings at all times apart from during the race.[7] Competitors will also start in five different timeslots, to minimize crowding on the course.[8]

The marathon distance is officially 42.195 kilometres (26.219 mi) long as sanctioned by World Athletics (IAAF).[9] The New York City Marathon starts at Fort Wadsworth on Staten Island, New York City. The first two miles of the course stay on the island, before the runners cross the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge into Brooklyn. The streets in this borough are flat and the runners remain here until mile 12. The runners then enter Queens before crossing the Queensboro Bridge at mile 13.[10]

After crossing the bridge, the runners enter Manhattan and run down First Avenue. The runners then enter The Bronx for miles 19 and 20 and pass the 'Entertainment Zone' which includes bands and dancers. The course then re-enters Manhattan for the final 6.2 miles (10.0 km). After running through Harlem, there is a slight uphill section along Fifth Avenue before it flattens out and runs parallel to Central Park. The course then enters the park around mile 24, passes Columbus Circle at mile 25 and re-enters the park for the finish.[10]

The elite women's race will feature Peres Jepchirchir, who won the marathon event at the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics,[11] and has the fastest personal best time of all competitors in the field.[12] Molly Seidel, who came third in the Olympic marathon, is also scheduled to compete,[13] and it will be the first New York City Marathon for both Jepchirchir[14][15] and Seidel.[13] Ababel Yeshaneh and Nancy Kiprop, who came second and fourth respectively at the 2019 Chicago Marathon are also scheduled to feature,[14] as is 2018 Boston Marathon winner Des Linden. Americans Sally Kipyego, Aliphine Tuliamuk and Emily Sisson are also expected to compete.[11] 2019 winner Joyciline Jepkosgei will not compete, as she chose to run the 2021 London Marathon instead.[16]
